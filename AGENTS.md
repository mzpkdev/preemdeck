## Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- pip3
- uv

Bootstrap:

- `uv sync`

## Format on edit

A project-local hook runs `ruff format` (`.py`) and `mdformat` (`.md`) after every agent edit on Claude Code, Codex, and
Gemini CLI. It never blocks the edit — failures warn on stderr.

| File                        | Role                                    |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `scripts/format_on_edit.py` | Shared script — single source of truth  |
| `.claude/settings.json`     | Claude: `PostToolUse` → script          |
| `.codex/config.toml`        | Codex: `[[hooks.PostToolUse]]` → script |
| `.gemini/settings.json`     | Gemini: `AfterTool` → script            |

**Codex trust:** first run prompts you to trust the project — accept it, or `.codex/config.toml` is silently ignored.
(Alt: pre-add `[projects."/abs/path/to/preemdeck"] trust_level = "trusted"` to `~/.codex/config.toml`.)

Full-repo format pass: `uv run task format`.

## Tests

- Repo-level suite (root `tests/`): `uv run pytest` from the repo root — what CI runs.
- Wire server suite (`ripperdoc/wetware/wire/server/tests/`, 202 tests):
  `cd ripperdoc/wetware/wire/server && uv run pytest`. uv resolves the `wire` workspace member and auto-syncs its `dev`
  group (pytest, pytest-asyncio, httpx) into the shared `.venv`. The `wire:start`/`wire:stop` runtime path uses
  `uv run --no-sync wire …` and is unaffected.

## Applying changes to ~/.claude

Editing this repo does **not** update a running harness. `~/.claude` is its own preemdeck clone; plugins install as a
**pinned copy** under `~/.claude/plugins/cache/`, not a symlink — so an edit here stays invisible until that clone is
pulled and the CLI restarts.

**Apply on explicit request only. When the user asks to update their local copy / apply to `~/.claude`, run `update.py`
against it yourself — you know the command, don't bounce it back. But only when asked: never apply unprompted after an
edit, and never run `install.py` yourself — that one stays the user's call.** Both installers are destructive by design:
`update.py` does `git reset --hard` (discards uncommitted work in the target), and `install.py`'s `.trash` step deletes
`AGENTS.md`, `scripts/`, `tests/`, `pyproject.toml`, etc. — it's a one-shot bootstrap for a throwaway clone, not the dev
repo.

Canonical flow — run on request (step 2 is yours now; `install.py` never is):

```bash
git -C ~/preemdeck add -A && git commit -m "…" && git push   # 1. dev repo: commit + push
cd ~/.claude && python3 update.py                            # 2. deployed clone: pull + re-install
```

Then restart the host CLI — plugins load at startup.
